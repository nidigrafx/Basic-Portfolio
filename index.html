    <p>
        I'm Nikko, I'm currently a system engineer/av engineer with 7-Eleven Corporation in Irving Texas. I'm a Jamaican National and grew up in Florida.  I played basketball at USF, I then went 
        on to play professional in South America.  I received my engineering degree in San Antonio.  I've been in IT for about 14 years.  I have two adult children and a teenager.  I've traveled 
        around the world for leisure.  I am a 3D Artist using Cinema4D, I paint, and do graphic design.  I've been in Texas for over 20 years off and on.
        I look forward to my new career as a developer/programmer.
